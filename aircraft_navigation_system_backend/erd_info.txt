Relationships for ER Diagram
----------------------------
1. Aircraft - Aircraft_Navigation: One-to-Many
   - One aircraft can have multiple navigation systems installed.

2. Aircraft - Flights: One-to-Many
   - One aircraft can operate multiple flights.

3. Flights - Routes: Many-to-One
   - Each flight follows one route.

4. Routes - Airports: Many-to-One
   - Each route connects two airports: a departure and an arrival airport.

5. Flights - Pilots (Optional): Many-to-Many
   - Pilots fly multiple flights; flights can be flown by multiple pilots.
